# AzureSignInLogReports

After installing the AzureADPreview Module and Connecting to you tenant, I have two different reports you can run. I have the output sorted for better viewer pleasure. You can remove the filter and add or remove the selected fields for the long version of everyuser in the tenant. This brought to the attention of the agency we had a user whose credentials were being logged into from India. Happy Hunting!
